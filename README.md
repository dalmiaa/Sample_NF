### Introduction
dalmiaa/Sample_NF: A trial pipline to understand how NF piplines work.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker / singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
